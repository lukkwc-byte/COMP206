# COMP206
This is a mock Facebook website a classmate and I built in 2 weeks for out COMP 206 class. The rules were to have a C, Python, and Perl backend. Front end was limited to ONLY HTML. No CSS. As such our design options were limited (i.e. excuse how non-aesthetically pleasing it looks)

This was my first time using github and apparently all my commits registered as Niko's lol. making it look like I did nothing. Thanks Niko
